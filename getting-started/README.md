# About this book

This book is aimed at the experienced industry CSS author but takes pains not to
*exclude* the less experienced. Each chapter includes an introduction designed
to explain the history and set of problems solved by each section. This will aid
the less experienced while more experienced authors will be able to scan the
table of contents and jump to interesting sections much more easily.

The approaches in this book are opinionated; For example, we suggest using
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and
[PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss). Neither is strictly
required but replacing PostCSS will require a lot of extra work and
replacing webpack with gulp, for example, is more trivial.

The reader should feel comfortable hopping around the chapters to read what is
most interesting or relevant to them. The chapters are not strictly
ordered but rather grouped into similar problem sets. There is a
section on enabling future CSS syntax and another on grids and
vertical rhythm.
