# Normalize.css

In the example projects we use normalize.css.
[Normalize.css][normalize] is a small CSS file that provides better
cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML
elements. Itâ€™s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional
CSS reset.

This yields a consistent base from which to build component libraries
that work across a number of devices.
