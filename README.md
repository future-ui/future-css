# Preface

CSS has come a long way since it's introduction. This book will go over a number
of problems encountered when writing CSS in 2016 and then present modern
solutions. This includes alternatives to BEM, sprite generation and controlling
the cascade.

Since [IE is Dead](), we will be focusing on supporting evergreen browsers where
appropriate. If you need really old browser support, there are packs such as
[oldie](https://github.com/jonathantneal/oldie) which can help you, so do not be
discouraged!
